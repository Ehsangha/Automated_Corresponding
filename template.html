    <p>Dear Professor {{ProfessorName}},</p>
    
    <p>My name is Ehsan Ghavimehr, and I recently graduated with an M.D. from the top private medical university in Iran, ranking in the top 5% of my class with a GPA equivalent to 3.37 (WES). My thesis focused on evaluating the role of nitric oxide neurotransmitters on the reactivation of fear memory extinction in rat models of PTSD, which has strengthened my passion for cognitive psychology and neuroscience research.</p>
    
    <p>I have developed strong skills in experimental design, data analysis, and laboratory techniques, including animal behavioral models, stereotaxic surgery, and molecular neuroscience methods. My medical background equips me with a unique perspective on cognitive processes and their clinical applications. I am confident that my skills and experiences can contribute meaningfully to your research in cognitive psychology.</p>
    
    <p>I have attached my CV for your review and invite you to visit <a href="https://ghavimehr.com/cv">my personal website</a> for more detailed information about my qualifications. I am highly motivated to join your research team as a Ph.D. student or research fellow at the {{University}} and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I might contribute to your work.</p>
    
    <p>{{PersonalizedParagraph}}</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of collaborating with you.</p>


    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

    <p><strong>Ehsan Ghavimehr, M.D.</strong></p>
